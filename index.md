I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science at the *University of Cambridge* currently researching the theoretical and empirical capacity of graph neural networks to understand and exploit the graph structure.

Last summer, I interned at *Alchera Technologies* where I researched neural network architectures for spatio-temporal graph-structured data (such as roads traffic prediction). 

I have previously interned as a Software Engineer in companies such as *IBM* and *STMicroelectronics* and developed numerous other projects on my own. I got passionate about science and technology during high school thanks to inspiring teachers and scientific Olympiads, where I had the honour of representing Italy in international competitions.

I am also part of the core team and mentor at *[LeadTheFuture](https://leadthefuture.tech)*, a nonprofit organization with the goal of helping talented Italian university and high school students reach their potential.
