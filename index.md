I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science at the *University of Cambridge* currently researching the field of *Graph Representation Learning*.

I have recently published an [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05718) of the expressivity of Graph Neural Networks, where we generalise previous theoretical results to continuous feature spaces and propose the *Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation*, an empirically powerful aggregator.

Last summer, I interned at *Alchera Technologies* where I researched neural network architectures for spatio-temporal graph-structured data (such as roads traffic prediction). 

I have previously interned as a Software Engineer in companies such as *IBM* and *STMicroelectronics* and developed numerous other projects on my own. I got passionate about science and technology during high school thanks to inspiring teachers and scientific Olympiads, where I had the honour of representing Italy in international competitions.

I am also part of the core team and mentor at *[LeadTheFuture](https://leadthefuture.tech)*, a nonprofit organization with the goal of helping talented Italian university and high school students reach their potential.
