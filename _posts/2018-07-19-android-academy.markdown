You can find [here](https://github.com/gcorso/android_academy) the GitHub repository with the documentation for the project. The repository is a boilerplate of an Android Studio project and includes layout files, activities control and database integration, everything already set up for you so that you can get a headstart to bring your project to life. 

The goal of this project is to provide a tool for educators to create their learning platform without spending a lot of time and resources on them and without having to have a great knowledge of Android development.
